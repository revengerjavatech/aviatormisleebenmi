## What is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is a \"crash game\" where players bet on a plane\'s ascent and
attempt to cash out before it crashes. The longer the plane stays in the
air, the higher the multiplier, but if you wait too long, you risk
losing your bet. It's an easy-to-understand, high-adrenaline game that's
gaining popularity worldwide. The thrill of the game comes from its
unpredictable nature, where players need to act quickly to maximize
their winnings.
